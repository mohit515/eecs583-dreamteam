- make changes in the tex
- compile with latex to check any errors
- compile with pdflatex instead of latex if you want it to directly make a pdf
- enter all the reference that you get from papers in paper.bib
- if changes are made to the bibliography run: pdflatex paper; bibtex paper; pdflatex paper; pdflatex paper OR just ./make.sh takes care of all the typing for you
  - the reason for all the pdflatex calls is to make sure it links properly
